## Hashicorp SC Exercise


### Consul â€“ connect services with mutual TLS

A prospect is interested in establishing mutual TLS between applications or services

* Demonstrate consul connect establishing connectivity and service segmentation between a Tomcat app or another app and a database.
* Demonstrate denying access from the app to the database using intentions toggle approval or denial of connectivity (live demo)
* Describe the solution, slides, Consul UI, etc
* Be ready to answer technical questions about the solution, compared to GTM, etc

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
---

* Install [Clojure](www.clojure.org)
* Install [Leiningen](www.leiningen.org).
* [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/) is the database used but is included in this exercise.
* Install [Hashicorp's Consul](https://www.consul.io/) to handle your service discovery, segmentation and configuration.


#### Running The Code
---

1. Start Derby. From a terminal, change into the hashi directory and run the startdb.sh script

````bash  
$ cd hashi
$ ./startup.sh
````

2. Start the web application server

````bash  
$ lein clean; lein run
````

3. Start the consul agent
````bash  
./startcon.sh
````

This basically executes
````
## kick off without -enablechecks
consul agent -dev -enable-script-checks -config-dir=../consul -node aurelius

````

which is
 * dev mode enabled
 * script checking prevents arbitrary malicious execution of code by the agent
 * supply a configuration directory
 * name this consul agent node because my machine does not have a friendly name - i want it easy!

4. Start the proxies

 ````bash  
./startproxies.sh
 ````

 This will background the proxies for both the app server and database server.

5. Check out the web UI and you should see something like the following

![services](./resources/images/services.png)

and health checks should show healthy sidecar proxies and services

 ![health](./resources/images/healthchecks.png)

 You should also see your ports setup as follows
